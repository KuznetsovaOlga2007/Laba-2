# Math formulas
## Area
- Circle: S = πR²
- Rectangle: S = ab
- Square: S = a²
- Triangle: S = ah/2

## Perimeter
- Circle: P = 2πR
- Rectangle: P = 2(a + b)
- Square: P = 4a
- Triangle: P = a + b + c


# How the programs works
The project includes 4 files: [circle.py](/circle.py), [rectangle.py](/rectangle.py), [square.py](/square.py) and [triangle.py](/triangle.py). Each of them, when entering a parameter of the corresponding shape (side length or radius), calculates and outputs the area and perimeter of this shape using mathematical formulas.

> *All further formulas used to calculate the area and perimeter can be found in ***Math formulas***.*

## About ***[circle.py](/circle.py)***
```python
import math


def area(r):
    return math.pi * r * r
'''According to the given radius of the circle outputs its area.
        Parameters: 
            r(int or float) - radius of the circle;
            pi - math constant;
        Return value:
            area(r) - area of a circle with this radius. 
'''

def perimeter(r):
    return 2 * math.pi * r
'''According to the given radius of the circle outputs its perimeter.
        Parameters: 
            r(int or float) - radius of the circle;
            pi - math constant;
        Return value:
            perimeter(r) - perimeter of a circle with this radius.

## About ***[rectangle.py](/rectangle.py)***
```python
def area(a, b): 
    return a * b 
'''According to the given lengths of the sides of the rectangle outputs its area.
        Parameters: 
            a(int or float) - the length of the one side of the rectangle;
            b(int or float) - the length of the second side of the rectangle;
        Return value: 
            area(a, b) - area of a rectangle with this sides. 
'''

def perimeter(a, b): 
    return (a + b) * 2 
'''According to the given lengths of the sides of the rectangle outputs its perimeter.
        Parameters: 
            a(int or float) - the length of the one side of the rectangle;
            b(int or float) - the length of the second side of the rectangle;
        Return value: 
            perimeter(a, b) - perimeter of a rectangle with this sides. 
'''

## About ***[square.py](/square.py)***
> *Note that a **square** is a special case of a **rectangle**, that is, to calculate the area and perimeter of a **square**, you can use and **rectangle.py** (a and b will be equal)*
```python
def area(a):
    return a * a

'''According to the given lengths of the side of the square outputs its area.
        Parameters: 
            a(int or float) - the length of the side of the square;
        Return value: 
            area(a) - area of a square with this side. 
'''
def perimeter(a):
    return 4 * a
'''According to the given lengths of the side of the square outputs its perimeter.
        Parameters: 
            a(int or float) - the length of the side of the square;
        Return value: 
            perimeter(a) - perimeter of a square with this side. 
'''
```
***Launch example:***
```
Side of the square: 7
Area: 49
Perimeter: 28
```
## About ***[triangle.py](/triangle.py)***
```python
def area(a, h): 
    return a * h / 2 
'''According to the given lengths of the sides of the triangle outputs its area.
        Parameters: 
            a(int or float) - the length of the one side of the triangle;
            h(int or float) - the length of the height drawn to this side;
        Return value: 
            area(a, h) - area of a triangle with this sides. 
'''
def perimeter(a, b, c): 
    return a + b + c 
'''According to the given lengths of the sides of the triangle outputs its perimeter.
        Parameters: 
            a(int or float) - the length of the one side of the triangle;
            b(int or float) - the length of the second side of the triangle;
            c(int or float) - the length of the third side of the triangle;
        Return value: 
            perimeter(a, b, c) - perimeter of a triangle with this sides. 
'''
```

> *In fact, it is not necessary to know the **height** of the triangle, three of its sides will be enough to calculate the area (according to **[Heron's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula)**)*

***Launch example:***
```
First side of the triangle: 4
Second side of the triangle: 5
Third side of the triangle: 6
Height drawn to first side: 4.9607837082461075
Area: 9.921567416492215
Perimeter: 15
